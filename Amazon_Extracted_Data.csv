Jaynil Soni,8 April 2025,4.2 out of 5 stars,"Good Mouse, a little bulky. Battery is average and no indicator.","I would have rated this 5/5, because of it's looks and price. However, 1 deducted for two reasons.First, the pros:1. The lights are absolutely beautiful. They keep changing and merging, lighting up the mouse and the logo.2. Color is good.3. Built is very strong.4. Connection us fast.5. Extremely sensitive to touch, still precise.The cons:1. Battery backup is not good, compared to other mouse at the same price range,2. There is no battery level indicator, which many others provide at the same price.3. Size a bit bulky. I would not recommend this to people with small hands.Overall, seems to be good at this price range.Tip: Go for the black color, it is definitely better than white and looks more elegant."
Anish,12 April 2025,,Bang for buck value nothing fancy just practical,"It's ideal for the budget, i was worried if it would be too small for my big hands. But it's not too small. RGB lights gave up after 2 months but it works really well which was my priority.so overall a good but."
Tridib Bhuniya,28 April 2025,,A good mouse WITH A FLAW,"Ok so ive been using this mouse for nearly a month and so far its comfortable to hold buttons are ok for the price ,i bought it for around Rs550 , and RGB is mid at best , it is smooth with a mouse pad and set at highest DPI . BUT THE MAJOR ISSUE is the Battery life,  ABSOLUTELY HORRID with rgb i got it to around 1.5 days max and wthout it its around 3 dys IF YOUR LUCKY more commonly 2 days , also i am running it with the provided dongle , SO its a PRETTY GOOD MOUSE WITH A MAJOR CON , if you can live with charging it often then its alright"
